# Bird Species Classification using CNN

# Overview

This project is a deep learning-based bird species classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on an image dataset of various bird species to automatically identify them.

# Features

Deep Learning with TensorFlow/Keras: Implements a CNN for image classification.

Dataset Handling: Efficient data loading, augmentation, and preprocessing.

Performance Evaluation: Accuracy metrics, confusion matrix, and visualization of results.

Customizable: Easily adaptable to different datasets and model architectures.

# Model Architecture

The model consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max pooling.

Fully connected layers for classification.

Uses softmax activation for multi-class classification.

# Results

After training, the model achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% (based on dataset and parameters). A confusion matrix and sample predictions are also provided for evaluation.

# Future Improvements

Implement transfer learning using ResNet50, MobileNetV2, or EfficientNet.

Improve data augmentation techniques.

Deploy the model using a web-based interface with Streamlit or Flask.
